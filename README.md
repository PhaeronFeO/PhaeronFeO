Hi I'm Ian Mussell,

This is were I store projects I have done a decent job of making, mostly for any lovely people from job applications are looking to see if I actually can code in python.
I have a lot more than is put on here as I prefer to keep a smaller number of higher quality projects for show, instead of a wide array of small throwaway programs.
